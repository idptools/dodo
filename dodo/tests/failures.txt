# Uniprot IDs of stuff DODO failed on. Compiling these over time to make sure that as people find problems with DODO, I don't break previous fixes with new 'fixes', which wouldn't really be a fix because... I'd be breaking something else. Such is the fun of coding.

I'll use these eventually to make 'the_alex_test.py' or 'Ryan_vs._the_FUTURE_OF_BIOPHYSICS.py' or something like that as an automated test.

Current fails (to date...), last updated October 30, 2023 at way too late but whatever.

    Credit: Stephen P. from the Holehouse Lab, the first person to remind me that I can't deploy something in 2 weeks without significant amounts of bugs (and probably typos). I don't use spell check for any of my documentation, it's the closest I get to 'living on the edge'. Also, if Stephen is somehow on the job market, hire Stephen. He's an incredible scientist. 
2. TDP43 - Q13148
    Credit: Me (Ryan, if you hadn't figured that out)! Some call this testing. They would be wrong. I found it when meeting with collaborators... well after pushing my most recent udpate.

    Credit: Alex Holehouse. The future of biophysics, a great member of the department, and a certifiably 'high risk high reward' investigator (see - https://commonfund.nih.gov/newinnovator/AwardRecipients) but more importantly a great PI, mentor, and person. He let me name this thing DODO, the silliest bird according to ChatGPT 3.5!
4. TBD. Come at me, fixing bugs is the name of the game! Jeff, if you're reading this ... be nice please and thank you (jokes aside, Jeff is also a great person).
