# list of stuff to do
'''
• Move everything off of the pdb_dictionary to the PDBParser class
• Add in function to return all atom of folded regions and just Ca for the
IDRs (until can add in all atom)
• Figure out all atom placement for IDRs
• Add documentation for everything
• Add tests for everything
• Make sure after moving everything to PDBParser, index for everything is correct (0 indexed)
• Figure out CONECT lines for all atom?
• Make new check_distance function for all atom stuff. Right now get some clashing from 
alpha carbon of the IDR next to all atom regions. 
• change over to mdtraj for to first make a topology, then add bonds (correctly..), then make pdb? Try is_min_distance_satisfied_all_atom
• Rewrite build to not be so ... bad and repetetive, add checks for
failing early so time is not wasted before failing.
• Add more functionality for moving FDs away from each other. 
• Add in functiionality to randomly place FDs in they end up clashing after translation.
